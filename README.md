- 👋 Hi, I’m @spaceroborg. Graduated in Aerospace Engineering and Bio-inspired Robotics from Imperial College London.
- 👀 I’m interested in Drones, Spacecrafts, Aerospace systems, Flight stability and dynamics, Bio-inspired and multi-modal robots.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C++, ROS2, RUST.
- 🛠️ I'm building a robo car that can detect obstacles and fly over them.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Aerial robotics and Aircraft systems engineering projects.
- 📫 How to reach me email: riya.n.gujarathi@gmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The F-15C thrust to weight ratio can exceed 1.4 to 1. This means it can climb vertically using just its engines. It does not need lift to fly!
